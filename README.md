# CpuTemp

CPU Temperature for Lumia 950 XL Running Windows 10.

Simple console app that uses Windows Management Instrumentation to gather cpu temperature and display on the console window. It's x86 app that runs on x86/x86_64/ARM64 architectures. Later will come native ARM64 binary.

**WHY?** 

Because currently there are no any ready-to-run solutions for Lumia 950 (XL) ARM64 architecture, 
only some PowerShell scripts and they are very slow.
